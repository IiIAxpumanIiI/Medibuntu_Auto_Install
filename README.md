This script detects a system's architecture, then downloads and installs the appropriate Medibuntu repository.  
Because of restrictions in certain locations, these packages are not installed by default in Ubuntu. You'll need to do your research to see if installing this repo puts you in violation of some law. I'm just showing you how to do this. 

You can do what you want with this script. It's just a little project I worked on to make life easier. It's tested to work in all versions of Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. 

Peace & Commitment.
